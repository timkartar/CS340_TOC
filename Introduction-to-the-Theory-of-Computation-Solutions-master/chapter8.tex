\item[8.6]Show that any PSPACE-hard language is also NP-hard.
\\
\textbf{Solution:} by definition of PSPACE-hardness for a language $L$, for all $A \in$ PSPACE, $A \le_P L$. Since SAT $\in$ NP, SAT $\in$ PSPACE because NP $\subseteq$ PSPACE. Therefore, SAT $\le_P L$. Since SAT is NP-complete, it is NP-hard. Therefore since SAT $\le_P L$, $L$ is NP-hard (by transitivity of $\le_P$).
